# 🧬 Biohacking Protocol - Bryan Johnson Style

**Comprehensive health optimization tracking**

---

## 📊 What to Track Daily

### Core Metrics (Talk to Omi)

#### 1. **Morning Routine** (7:00-8:00 AM)
```
"Morning stats:
- Weighed X kg
- Resting heart rate X bpm (from watch/phone)
- Sleep score X/100 (from watch)
- Mood X/10
- Energy X/10
- HRV X ms (if tracked)"
```

**Why:** Baseline biomarkers, detect overtraining/illness early

#### 2. **Nutrition** (Throughout day)
```
Already tracking:
✅ Food items & calories
✅ Macros (protein, carbs, fat)

Add:
"Supplements today:
- Vitamin D 2000 IU
- Omega-3 1000mg
- Creatine 5g
- Whey protein 50g"

"Water intake: X liters"
```

**Why:** Micronutrient optimization, hydration status

#### 3. **Exercise** (Throughout day)
```
Already tracking:
✅ Workouts, exercises, sets/reps

Add:
"Cardio: 20min walk, avg HR 120bpm"
"Steps today: 8,500 steps"
"Active time: 90 minutes"
```

**Why:** Cardiovascular health, NEAT tracking

#### 4. **Recovery** (Evening)
```
Already tracking:
✅ Sleep hours & quality
✅ Muscle soreness

Add:
"Evening stats:
- Stress level X/10
- Readiness X/10 (how ready for tomorrow)
- Any pain/discomfort: location + severity
- Bowel movement: X times, quality good/bad"
```

**Why:** GI health, stress management, readiness scoring

#### 5. **Mental Performance** (Throughout day)
```
"Focus today: X/10
- Best hours: 9-11 AM
- Brain fog at: 3 PM
- Productivity: X/10"

"Meditation: X minutes"
"Deep work: X hours"
```

**Why:** Cognitive optimization, productivity tracking

## 🧪 Weekly Measurements (Every Sunday)

### Body Composition
```
"Weekly measurements:
- Weight: X kg
- Body fat: X% (calipers or impedance scale)
- Chest: X cm
- Arms: X cm (flexed)
- Waist: X cm
- Thighs: X cm"
```

### Performance Tests
```
"Weekly tests:
- Max push-ups: X
- Plank hold: X seconds
- Resting HR: X bpm (7-day avg)
- VO2 max estimate: X ml/kg/min (from watch)
- Grip strength: X kg (if available)"
```

### Biochemistry (If tracking)
```
"Blood work results:
- Glucose: X mg/dL
- Cholesterol: X mg/dL
- Testosterone: X ng/dL
- Vitamin D: X ng/mL"
```
*(every 3-6 months, or as prescribed)*

## 🎯 Bryan Johnson-Style Biomarkers

### Longevity Focused (Advanced)

If you want to go deeper:

#### Blood Biomarkers (Every 3-6 months)
```
Core panel:
• Fasting glucose (< 100 mg/dL optimal)
• HbA1c (< 5.7% optimal)
• LDL cholesterol (< 100 mg/dL)
• HDL cholesterol (> 40 mg/dL)
• Triglycerides (< 150 mg/dL)
• TSH (thyroid: 1-2 mIU/L optimal)
• Vitamin D (40-60 ng/mL optimal)
• Testosterone (> 500 ng/dL for males)
• CRP (inflammation: < 1 mg/L optimal)

Track via: "Blood work results: Glucose 88, LDL 95..."
```

#### Sleep Quality (Every night)
```
From smart watch/ring:
• Total sleep: 7-8 hours
• Deep sleep: 1.5-2 hours (20-25%)
• REM sleep: 1.5-2 hours (20-25%)
• Sleep efficiency: > 85%
• Awakenings: < 2 per night

Log: "Sleep data: 7.5hr total, 1.8hr deep, 1.6hr REM"
```

#### Heart Rate Variability (Daily)
```
Morning HRV:
• > 60 ms = well recovered
• 40-60 ms = moderate recovery
• < 40 ms = poor recovery (overtraining?)

Log: "HRV today: 58ms"
```

#### Grip Strength (Weekly)
```
Predictor of all-cause mortality:
• Males: > 40 kg optimal
• Track both hands

Log: "Grip: Left 42kg, Right 45kg"
```
