## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Claude says "I can't see your Airtable":**
- Restart Claude Desktop
- Check config file has Airtable MCP
- Verify PAT in config

**Macros seem wrong:**
- Claude uses reference data from Macro Calculation Rules
- Add more foods to that table for better accuracy
- Provide portion context ("1 katori" vs "large bowl")

**I forgot to log a meal:**
- Just tell Claude: "I ate X at Y time, log it"
- Claude will backdate the entry

---

## 🚀 THAT'S IT!

**You know enough to start. Everything else is in the other docs.**

**Just remember:**
1. Photo → Claude → "Log this"
2. 3,000 cal, 130g protein daily
3. Weigh-in every Sunday
4. 60kg in 8 weeks

**GO! 💪**
